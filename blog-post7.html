  <div class="post-date">April 18, 2025</div>
  <p><em>I spent my spring break in a needle park this year. And when school started up again, it felt like I had jumped from one world into another too quickly. What I saw in Philly stayed in Philly—until Stations of the Cross today, when the faces returned, and I realized I couldn’t unsee the living face of the suffering Christ.</em></p>

  <h3>First Station: Jesus is Condemned to Death</h3>
  <p>I had no idea what I signed up for with Mission Exchange. My motives were nothing like the mission’s core. But somewhere along the way, I began to see how God weaves our personal desires with His greater purpose. </p>

  <h3>“Kensington.”</h3>
  <p>They told us the night before. That night, fear shook me—different from the usual kind. Not the fear of failing or not being enough. This was fear of people. Fear of place. I had grown up in a bubble. And the next morning, I was about to step out of it.</p>

  <h3>Second Station: Jesus Accepts His Cross</h3>
  <p>We were on the streets, all in gray shirts, carrying bags—PB&J sandwiches, clothing, prayer cards. One bag held a hammer, nails, and a massive wooden cross.</p>
  <p>For three days we walked Kensington, praying with people, writing intentions on sticky notes, and nailing them to that cross.</p>
  <p>Near the top, I added my own intention. It was small—almost silly—but that’s the beauty of the Cross. It holds not just the cries but also the soft smiles, the things that make us blush. All of it belongs there.</p>

  <h3>Third Station: Jesus Falls the First Time</h3>
  <p>I made eye contact with a woman across the street. She crossed over. Unsteady. I prayed with my hand on her shoulder, and her weight sank into me. She was high—literally falling. I held both her shoulders, bracing her body as I prayed. Then, just like that, she left. I watched her wobble away, the weight of her still pressed into me.</p>

  <h3>Fourth Station: Jesus Meets His Afflicted Mother</h3>
  <p>We stayed with a sweet chechi and her three giggling kids. Every night felt like returning from the trenches to a cradle. What a gift to have a home to come back to. What a gift to be held like that.</p>

  <h3>Fifth Station: Simon Helps Jesus Carry the Cross</h3>
  <p>At Sarnelli House, I served food. I felt joy scooping potatoes onto plates of my brothers and sisters. The ovens’ warmth, the smells, the music—it felt like home. One man struggled to carry his plate atop a tower of bags. I hesitated. Then I asked, “Can I help you?” His “yes” was immediate. I carried his bags, walked him to a seat, and brought him something to drink. That was my Simon moment. And it felt right.</p>

  <h3>Sixth Station: Veronica Offers Her Veil to Jesus</h3>
  <p>We passed a man with blood around his eye. I looked away. Ann didn’t. She asked him if she could help clean it. He said no. She asked again, gently. He walked off. But I stood in awe. Ann, how do you have a heart like that?</p>

  <h3>Seventh Station: Jesus Falls the Second Time</h3>
  <p>Car rides were our joy. Nimmy Chechi sang in Spanish, Angel played Portuguese songs, and Rosa Chechi tried to teach Abbey and me Hindi. If we weren’t knocked out, we were laughing. Five girls, one car, and a soundtrack of joy we never turned off.</p>

  <h3>Eighth Station: Jesus Meets His Afflicted Mother</h3>
  <p>I cried kneeling in front of the abortion clinic downtown. Rosary clenched, heart helpless, I watched women walk in and prayed: </p>
  <blockquote>“Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”</blockquote>

  <h3>Ninth Station: Jesus Falls the Third Time</h3>
  <p>Joseph looked at my love and said he had a thing for this.</p>
  <p>He looked at me and said I had a thing for this.</p>
  <p>He looked at us and said we had a thing for this.</p>

  <h3>Tenth Station: Jesus is Stripped of His Garments</h3>
  <p>I watched Rebecca Chechi talk to a man on the street. He was tough, guarded. When she asked to pray with him, he joked, “You don’t wanna touch me.”</p>
  <p>She smiled and said, “Then I’ll hold your hand.”</p>
  <p>His bravado softened. He offered his hand to her. Then to me. I was scared, but I took it. That small touch shattered something old in both of us.</p>

  <h3>Eleventh Station: Jesus is Nailed to the Cross</h3>
  <p>Kay said no to veggies.</p>
  <p>I said, “Eat yo veggies, Kay.”</p>
  <p>We laughed out loud.</p>

  <h3>Twelfth Station: Jesus Dies on the Cross</h3>
  <p>In the ache of Kensington, I found butterflies. I was falling in love. It was beautiful. Sometimes, to understand the depth of the Cross, you have to feel your heart race with love.</p>

  <h3>Thirteenth Station: Jesus is Taken Down from the Cross</h3>
  <p>We visited the Sisters of Life convent. I ran into Sister Mary Grace—who I had practically stalked at SEEK! She remembered me. The space was peaceful, the donation room full of baby clothes, like fresh life. </p>
  <p>Four flights of stairs humbled me, but the view at the top—downtown Philly through old, wide windows—stole my breath. I imagined teaching there. Goosebumps rose on my arms.</p>

  <h3>Fourteenth Station: Jesus is Laid in the Sepulcher</h3>
  <p>The streets of Kensington taught me to be unafraid.</p>
  <p>Unafraid to hold hands.</p>
  <p>Unafraid to give hugs.</p>
  <p>Unafraid to carry my cross.</p>

  <p>We ended the week in adoration. Music playing. I knelt before Jesus and whispered into the monstrance: “I’m all yours.”</p>
  <p>And as I bent low and kissed the altar ground, I felt like a princess.</p>
  <p>Before His throne, I felt crowned. Claimed. Loved.</p>
