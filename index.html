                    <p>hi! my name is sona :) having my own website has always been a dream of mine, and i promised myself that i would only ever have one if i built it myself from scratch. so here we are! </p>
                    <p>we all have our own ways of expressing ourselvesâ€”a form of art only <i>we</i> have mastered. i'm a believer that our blood and our inspirations influence our craft. my grandfather was a photographer. my other grandfather was known for singing out loud as he walked down the street. my mom used to write screenplays and short stories in college. but i'm also a believer that the way i write, the way i sing, and the way i see and capture the beauty of the world around me isn't the same as any of theirs. it's different. my story is not your story. but my story is beautiful, and so is yours. here i am sharing mine. and one day i hope to hear your's too :) </p>
